# gunbroker
Uses the GunBroker API to post auctions. Run from a LAMP server. Uses a DB to store information about the auctions and ensures the correct ones are posted.

# Goals
The goal is to make a site to input auction information about guns and then set the number of auctions to post. The program will create the auctions desired and ensure they have the correct settings and descriptions. The idea is the entire possible inventory is set up in the database and then stock is enabled for posting as it arrives.
